# Introduction

Hi there!

I am currently studying for a JavaScript certification and this repository is part of my extra study on NodeJS and JavaScript runtimes.

## What is NodeJS
NodeJS is a cross-platform, open-source, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code on the server. It provides an environment to run JavaScript outside of a web browser and allows developers to build server-side applications with JavaScript.

JavaScript runtimes, on the other hand, are environments in which JavaScript code can be executed. The most popular JavaScript runtime is the web browser, but there are other runtimes such as NodeJS, Electron, and Nashorn.

## Content
In this repository, you will find various resources and examples of NodeJS and JavaScript runtimes. I will cover topics such as the basics of NodeJS, how to use NodeJS modules, and how to build a web server with NodeJS. I will also explore the differences between NodeJS and other JavaScript runtimes and discuss the benefits of using NodeJS for server-side development.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository will provide you with valuable information and resources to help you better understand NodeJS and JavaScript runtimes.

So if you're ready to dive into the world of NodeJS and JavaScript runtimes, let's get started!
