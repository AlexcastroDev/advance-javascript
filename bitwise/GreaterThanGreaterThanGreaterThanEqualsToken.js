// In this code, you are performing a bitwise unsigned right shift assignment operation (>>>=) on the variable len. This operation shifts the bits of the value to the right by the specified number of positions and then assigns the result back to the variable.

// 25 in binary: 11001

let len = 25
len >>>= 1

// Original: 00000000000000000000000000011001
// Shifted:  00000000000000000000000000001100
len // 12

// The result of the unsigned right shift by 1 position is 12 in decimal.
// So, after the operation, the value of len becomes 12.
// In summary, the code len >>>= 1; shifts the value of len right by one position, resulting in the value of len becoming 12.
